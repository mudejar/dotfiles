# Mudejar's custom Neovim editor 
This editor is configured to be used as a replacement for much heavier IDE's I've used in the past, namely IntelliJ and VScode. Although still a work in progress, adding support for different languages has proven to at least be doable. This Neovim editor can be used for the following languages thus far:

Golang
Python
Vimscript
HTML
Lua
BASH

If you really wish to understand the basic structure of this Neovim editor, please refer to NvChad for a better understanding how this all works together.
